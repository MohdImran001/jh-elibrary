# JH E-Library
Website which keeps the record of all ebooks, notes and previous year papers. Specially designed for Jamia Hamdard Students.

I have created the admin panel (https://github.com/MohdImran001/admin-panel-elibrary) for this website which we can use to upload content easily to the website. 

This website fetches the content from MongoDB Atlas and Amazon S3 server.

This app is deployed on heroku
